Major Challenges:
	The form on the contact page gave us some trouble. It wasn't until
	the class we had on HTML forms, that we were able to figure out how
	to get it working.
	
	Striking the right balance between elaborate design and feasibility
	was a challenge. We had many ideas of how we wanted the web page to
	look, but with only so much time, we had to cut the ideas down to
	only what we thought we could finish in that time frame. Overall,
	we are happy with how the web page looks, but can also see areas
	in which it can be improved.

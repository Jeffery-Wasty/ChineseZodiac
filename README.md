This project required students to make a simple website that provided users with information on the Chinese Zodiac, including information on the origins of the zodiac and information on each animal, and associated traits, lucky things, good careers, etc. The website also included a contact page that posted to given information to a PHP page to demonstrate that the student had completed the contact page successfully. The student was expected to complete the page with raw HTML and CSS, i.e without the use of libraries such as Bootstrap.
